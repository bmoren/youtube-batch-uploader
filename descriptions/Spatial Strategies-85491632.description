Spatial Strategies is an SMS service and mobile phone app which facilitates walks through diverse environments which are free of a linear objective. Its goal is to set up contexts to become hyper aware, observe one’s surroundings in detailed, and aesthetic ways. In its first version, users of the app are able to specify a duration of the walk as well as set the interval of messages that they receive. It draws from influences like Guy Debord’s essay, The Derive and Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies.
