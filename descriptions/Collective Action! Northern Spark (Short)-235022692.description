Collective Action! is a performance game that invites you to work together with other participants to perform creative, collective actions that respond to climate change issues. Start by using your phone to explore the Collective Action! mobile website, create a unique avatar, join a team, and prepare to perform! For every action you perform over the course of the night, you’ll earn a point for yourself and your team, which you can track on the website’s game leaderboard. Collective Action! draws inspiration from the expansive history of non-competitive group games ranging from the New Games Foundation to fluxus experiments and performances, and earth day activities. Explore: how can your actions as an individual have a larger impact when they are performed in collaboration with others? Originally presented at Northern Spark 2017 with the support of Northern.Lights.mn and The McKnight Foundation.
