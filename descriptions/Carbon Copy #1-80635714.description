Carbon Copy is an ongoing series of videos first created during the Eco Artists Workshop on Mallard Island on Rainy Lake, MN. In each film, I progress onscreen and replace a natural element with another. This project touches on the ‘beautification’ of nature by human hands in an effort to tame or manicure it. Once the element is replaced, I gaze into the void that is created, almost like a child lost in a television set. Once the replacement feels sufficient I depart offscreen bringing the veil used to make the replacements with me. I then move onto a new location, perpetually seeking the most ‘ideal’ configuration from video to video.
