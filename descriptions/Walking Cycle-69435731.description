Walking Cycle is a large free-standing video installation made of four eight-foot-high walls covered in translucent projection material forming a pentagonal shaped room. Each of the four walls carries a video projection of a young male figure walking through a hilly natural landscape of trees and forests. I was the performer in each of the three pieces working with a cinematographer to shoot the video as I performed the actions of walking backwards through the rugged landscape. Later,  in post-production, the videos were reversed to facilitate the illusion of forward motion. The awkward movements and peculiarities of the performative gestures (produced when reversing the footage) gave rise to a feeling of uncanniness and dislocation from the natural world. The figure awkwardly moves across the landscape and from screen to screen, arising from and eventually disappearing behind the horizon. At first glance my movements appear natural, but as the viewer focuses their attention, my slightly twitchy and spasmodic movements (caused by playing the video in reverse) become more apparent. This sense of awkwardness in gait and gesture is difficult to decipher causing the view to question the reality of what they are observing. “What is he doing?” “Why does seem that he has so little control over his body?” “What is happening?”
To focus the viewers attention on the moving figure the video projected on to the other three screens remains still as he moves from the frames edge and disappears into the distance. As the performer leaves the frame and enters the next screen, that screen is activated and the previous screen’s action comes to a halt. The installation creates a perpetual loop as the performer continually repeats his ungainly journey across the four screens; the cyclical non-linear system repeats indefinitely and is programmed to play in a non-repeating-randomized loop eliminating the possibility of repetition from screen to screen.
