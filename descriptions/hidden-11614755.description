Hidden is a video piece filmed in minnesota during winter. Winter camouflage is used to attempt to create a seamless integration into the natural habitat. Due to the nature of camouflage and  its failing attempt to disguise its wearer, I visible in every scene from start to finish. This principle is reenforced by the usage of pine needle camouflage filmed in a forest that contains no pines.This visibility and invisibility relationship is where this void of information is created. It generates a space that lies between an object and the perception of its perception.
