Game Grid Presented at Northern Spark 2015. 
Game Grid is an outdoor social gaming platform played on a giant three-screen installation in the round. It is a dynamic social and physical video game that requires players to move around the installation and physically interact with other players. Numerous players can play Game Grid simultaneously, but the game is also engaging for as few as two participants going head to head. Game play draws inspiration from classic arcades of the 1980s and 1990s. Participants control Game Grid via a web page accessed on their smart phones. A special app is not required to play.
Game Grid is a collaboration between Ben Moren, John Kim, and Derek Anderson.
