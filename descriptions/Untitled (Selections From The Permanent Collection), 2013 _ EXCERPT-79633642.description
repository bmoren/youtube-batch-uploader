This project remixes the contemporary and historical operations of the Soap Factory by conflating contexts of labor, value, and critical language. Through the use of a personal media player, viewers are guided by a narrator through the galleries to experience a hidden, or ‘shadow’, exhibition of objects and performances. Each ‘shadow’ artwork becomes a touchstone to reflect upon contemporary aesthetic concepts.
