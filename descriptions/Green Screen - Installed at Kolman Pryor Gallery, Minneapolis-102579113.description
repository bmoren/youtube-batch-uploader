Green Screen addresses the falsification of the natural environment by creating a mediation between whats actually real, and our expectation of real things presented onscreen. Small cameras dynamically cut between live feeds of fake plants and present them as 'real' live plants onscreen. When viewers progress behind the projection screen, they are confronted with the manufactured disconnected micro environment containing the fake plants and fans simulating wind. This disconnection questions our everyday mediated world and how we easily misunderstand our surroundings without asking difficult questions.
