This project addresses digital and analog conversions. They are explored through film and video setups that focus on frame-rates. Two projectors face each other and project on back to back screens. Part one of the installation consists of a custom made, looping super8 projector that is projecting a film of a youtube video that is counting super8 frames. The second projector allows users to interact and capture frames through a mounted camera and custom interface, this builds a realtime stop motion animation of the surrounding gallery space. This animation is projected via a digital projector through the constant shuttering frame of a re-purposed super8 projector, causing further disconnect in the frame consistency. The capture mechanism is only capable of capturing an amount of frames equal to a super8 cartridge. Part three of the event allows viewers to shoot super8 film on a provided camera with a 50' piece of string attached to the camera (50 feet = 1 super8 cartridge) This film is then immediately developed and projected live during the event. The goal is to emulate the instant viewing feedback of digital photography while allowing for usage of an analog medium, with emphasis on its tactile nature.
