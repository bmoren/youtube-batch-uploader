Mobile Experiential Cinema is a multi-location projected cinematic experience with live performance, explored while biking.  Bring your bike, your curiosity, and your wits. We will traverse the city by bike, urgently seeking a resolution to an exhilarating mystery-thriller. On your trip, you will experience film segments, live action elements, and shadowy characters that will guide you through your adventure. Introduce yourself to the person next to you - they may be your key to success. Your vigilance will help you find the answer - and your way back to the present moment. The journey will lead us on to undiscovered streets and deep into the cracks of city - don't expect to end up where we started out - keep your eyes peeled and your wits sharp - things could get ugly out there!
This project premiered at the Northern Spark Festival in Minneapolis, MN
